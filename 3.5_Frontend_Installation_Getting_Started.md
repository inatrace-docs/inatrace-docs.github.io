## How it works

[](https://github.com/INATrace/fe?tab=readme-ov-file#how-it-works)

### Welcome page

[](https://github.com/INATrace/fe?tab=readme-ov-file#welcome-page)

This is the welcome page at [inatrace.org](https://inatrace.org/). From here, existing users can login by clicking "Login" in the top right corner. New users can click on "Read more" button, where they can get more info on how to get registered.

[![INAtrace welcome](../images/inatrace_welcome.png)](../images/inatrace_welcome.png)

### Registration

[](https://github.com/INATrace/fe?tab=readme-ov-file#registration)

New users must enter their name, surname, email and password. The terms and conditions have to be accepted. The submitted email address receives a confirmation link to confirm the email address. After confirming the email, a system admin must activate the account.
[![INAtrace registration](../images/inatrace_register.png)](../images/inatrace_register.png)


### Home

[](https://github.com/INATrace/fe?tab=readme-ov-file#home)

[![INAtrace home](../images/inatrace_home.png)](../images/inatrace_home.png)

This is the home page. In the left sidebar from top to bottom, we have the following links:

- Home
- Company
- Products
- Settings (System admin and Regional admin only)

The current user's products are displayed in the center, along with quick access links to stock, orders, customers, farmers, collectors and dashboard. Collectors quick access is shown only if the current user company has facilities that work with collectors. Customers quick access is shown only if the current user company has "Buyer" role in any Product. In the top right corner, an expandable menu contains quick links, user profile settings and a logout button.

If the user has multiple companies, an active company can be selected in the "User profile" section.

[![INAtrace_user_profile](../images/inatrace_user_profile.png)](../images/inatrace_user_profile.png)

### Products

[](https://github.com/INATrace/fe?tab=readme-ov-file#products)


Each company has its products which are visible in the products tab which is opened by clicking the above icon.

#### Product settings

[](https://github.com/INATrace/fe?tab=readme-ov-file#product-settings)

Each product can contain information like name, picture, origin, data about social responsibility, enviromental sustainability, etc. This is defined in the "Product settings".

#### QR labels

[](https://github.com/INATrace/fe?tab=readme-ov-file#qr-labels)

For traceability, QR labels with product information are created here.

[![Product_QR_labels](../images/inatrace_product_qr.png)](../images/inatrace_product_qr.png)

#### Stakeholders

[](https://github.com/INATrace/fe?tab=readme-ov-file#stakeholders)

Stakeholders are companies participating in the production of the final product. Companies from the system can be added here. Their roles can be:

- Buyer
- Importer

[![Product_stakeholders](../images/inatrace_product_stakeholders.png)](../images/inatrace_product_stakeholders.png)

#### Final products

[](https://github.com/INATrace/fe?tab=readme-ov-file#final-products)

Final products are retail products for sale to the end customers.

[![Product_final_products](../images/inatrace_product_final_product.png)](../images/inatrace_product_final_product.png)

#### B2C settings

[](https://github.com/INATrace/fe?tab=readme-ov-file#b2c-settings)

The public facing B2C page has editable colors, fonts and content to allow for corporate identity compliance. The settings are visible on `Product settings` and `QR labels` tabs.

The B2C configuration on the `Product settings` is automatically inherited by QR labels. If QR labels define another value, this value overrides the product values. This way QR labels inherit product settings by default, but can be changed on a label-by-label basis.

The following values can be customized:

- Colors
    - Primary
    - Secondary
    - Ternary
    - Quaternary
    - Header
    - Text
- Enable/disable tabs
    - Fair prices
    - Producers
    - Quality
    - Feedback
- Font (TTF, WOFF and WOFF2)
    - Product
    - Text
- Images
    - Header (PNG, JPG and JPEG)
    - Header background (PNG, JPG, JPEG and SVG)
    - Footer (PNG, JPG and JPEG)
