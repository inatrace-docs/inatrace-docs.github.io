# 2.1 Project Implementation Guide

Please note: This only includes the set-up of INATrace, not the data collection process.

## **Step 1: Assessment Phase**

**Goal:** Confirm feasibility, align stakeholders, and define the scope for INATrace deployment.

Identify the fundamental needs of your organization / company and other involved stakeholders regarding a traceability system (WHAT do you / they want to track and trace?).  Carefully evaluate if the needs align with the nature and system functionalities of INATrace to manage expectations. Get an understanding of the motivation of all supply chain companies to adopt a traceability system to ensure a successful implementation. Analyze any existing software used by companies and take into account that integration with other systems requires an programming work, i.e. an extra budget.

**Needs & Context Assessment**

- _Map the supply chain actors, their needs and expectations towards a traceability system._
- _Identify current traceability practices (paper-based, spreadsheets, ERP)._
- _Understand local IT environment (internet coverage, devices, digital literacy)._
- _Review relevant (local) legal frameworks (data privacy, export regulations)._


**Feasibility Assessment & Risk Analysis** 

To get a first idea if INATrace might be a good fit for the involved stakeholders, here is an overview of INATrace core functionalities and characteristics: 

- Offers provenance tracking, quality management, stock management, financial traceability and batch history summaries along the entire supply chain from farm level to market
- Aggregated data on farm performance, purchases and processing in form of dashboard view and report downloads
- Quality management along the chain: Allows to specify quality parameters of choice per product category
- Fully customizable user interface (products, company facilities, processing types, measurement units, currencies, terminology and language)
- All Chain of custody models supported (including identity preserved) + Customization of batch traceability
- Chain of custody functionality details: First Purchase, Processing, Merging batches, Splitting batches, Intermediate Purchases, Transportation, Export / Import documentation, Distribution, Trading, Recording Evidence for processes (e.g. photos), Comparison of processing outcomes with standard conversion rates, Accumulative volumes / reports)
- Polygon tracking + Deforestation check
- Certification documentation on farm and company level
- Offline recording via mobile app with limited functionalities (only farmers and plots for now, not for purchases and processing transactions)
- Interoperable 
- Company admin can manage user rights for all company users


- _Assess technical feasibility: server hosting options, internet bandwidth._
- _Identify capacity gaps (technical, organizational, financial, digital literacy)._
- _Plan some budget buffer._
- _Make a time and budget plan._

## **Step 2: Preparation & Planning Phase**

**Stakeholder Mapping & Engagement**

- _Identify: producers, cooperatives, exporters, government agencies, NGOs, IT-partners_
- _Conduct stakeholder workshops to align expectations._
- _Clarify ownership: Who will host, maintain, and operate the system?_
- _Elaborate long-term operation and maintenance after the project phase_

**Key Questions**

- _Which supply chains and product lines will be in scope initially?_
- _Which languages and other factors must be supported in the UI?_
- _Who will own and manage the data?_
- _Are there legal restrictions on hosting data?_
- _Who will operation &maintenance be ensured after the project ends?_

## **Step 3: Technical Setup & Local Partner Engagement**

**Goal:** Deploy a functioning INATrace instance with a sustainable support model.

**Source Code Access**

- _Retrieve INATrace open-source code from GitHub._
- _Check with the community if other persons are working on similar topics._

**Select Local IT Partner**

- _Experience with JavaScript/Node.js, PostgreSQL, Docker, APIs._
- _Proven track record in maintaining production systems._
- _Willingness to collaborate with international dev teams and the community_
- _If possible, experience in supply chains_

**Infrastructure & Hosting Decisions**

- _Cloud hosting (AWS, Azure, local cloud providers) vs. on-premise servers._
- _Consider compliance with local data protection laws._
- _Plan for backups, disaster recovery, and uptime guarantees._

**Deployment**

- _Set up development, staging, and production environments._
- _Build MVP_
- _Configure database, authentication, and API integrations._
- _Test installation with sample datasets._

**Key Questions**

- _Who is the long-term technical owner of the instance?_
- _Will data hosting comply with local regulations?_

## **Step 4: Customization for Local Needs**

**Goal:** Tailor INATrace to the specific supply chain requirements and user expectations.

**Localization**

- _Translate interface and notifications into local languages._
- _Adjust units of measurement, currency, and date formats._

**Workflow & Data Model Adaptation**

- _Modify data fields to match local requirements_
- _Add/remove steps to reflect local supply chain reality (e.g., multiple intermediaries)._

**Integration with Other Systems (if needed)**

- _Connect to customs/export systems, ERP, or mobile payment platforms._
- _Enable automated data exchange with other systems._
- _Integrate other DPI Building blocks_

**User Role & Permission Setup**

- _Define roles for farmers, cooperatives, exporters and government._
- _Restrict access to sensitive business data._

**Key Questions**

- _What supply chain steps differ from INATrace’s default workflows?_
- _Which external systems must it integrate with?_
- _Which additional reports, features or dashboards are needed?_

  
## **Step 5: Capacity Building & Training**

**Goal:** Ensure all user groups can operate the system effectively, with sustainable training structures.

**Train-the-Trainer (TTT) Program**

- _Identify key “multipliers” (cooperative leaders, extension officers, local IT team)._
- _Deliver intensive training covering system use, troubleshooting, and user support._
- _Criteria: digital literacy, local language proficiency, ability to teach adults._

**End-User Training**

- _Conduct hands-on sessions with mobile app and web platform._
- _Provide printed guides, e-learning modules, and short video tutorials in local languages._
- _Consider age, gender and socio-economic factors when conducting trainings_

**Support Structure**

- _Set up a local helpdesk (phone, WhatsApp, email)._
- _Define escalation paths for technical issues to local IT and then to the INATrace core team._

**Key Questions**

- _How will training for new users be managed over time?_
- _How will training materials stay up to date after system updates?_
- _How will high turnover among cooperative staff be addressed?_
- _Who will be in a position to manage the helpdesk? How is this financed?_

## **Step 6: Operations, Continuous Improvement & Community Contribution**

**Goal:** Maintain the system, improve based on feedback, and give back to the global INATrace community.

**Ongoing Operations**

- _Monitor uptime and performance._
- _Apply regular updates and security patches._
- _Manage user accounts and permissions._

**Feedback Loops**

- _Collect structured feedback from users every 3–6 months._
- _Prioritize improvements based on business and social impact._

**Community Engagement**

- _Share local enhancements with the INATrace GitHub repository_
- _Participate in INATrace community calls_
- _Document and share case studies._

**Sustainability Planning**

- _Budget for hosting, IT staff, and training in the medium to long term._
- _Explore partnerships for ongoing funding._

**Key Questions**

- _Who is responsible for code reviews before contributing changes back?_
- _How will new features be prioritized and tested?_
- _What governance model will guide decision-making for future developments?_

## **Step 7: Risk Management**

| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Risk**                              | **Mitigation**                                                            |
| **Lack of local IT capacity**         | Early engagement of skilled partners, on-the-job training                 |
| **Low adoption by users**             | Demonstrate benefits early, involve users in customization                |
| **High dependency on one individual** | Build team capacity, document processes                                   |
| **Funding gaps**                      | Secure multi-year budget commitments and develop long-term business model |
