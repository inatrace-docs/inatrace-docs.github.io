- Understanding the product journey from farmers to end-consumers including
processing details, document flows and financial flows

- Understanding the day-to-day activities of all companies involved in the chain.
Understanding personal roles and responsibilities of employees involved

- Understanding the type of documentation, devices and software the companies are
using at the moment


## PURPOSE of the value chain mapping

- On basis of the mapping results, being able to create a digital copy of the value chain
in INATrace which resembles the real-life processes as much as possible with the aim
to create an excellent user experience which motivates companies to use the system

- Being able to inform the software developers of any system changes necessary which
go beyond system configurations and company configurations
