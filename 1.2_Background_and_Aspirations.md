## INATrace – the tracing tool for sustainable supply chains 

INATrace is a **digital open-source solution** that puts people first. With the aim of improving the economic situation of smallholder farmers, INATrace focuses on the [traceability of global supply chains](https://www.sustainable-supply-chains.org/topics/digitalisation-traceability/). Better payment for producers at the beginning of the supply chain can only be secured if it becomes clear how little they receive for the raw material produced compared to other actors.   

On behalf of BMZ, GIZ has been working with users to develop an open source, expandable and transferable digital solution for tracing produce in agricultural supply chains. The application aims to render the supply chain transparent from production to the consumers. INATrace is already being used in several agricultural supply chains across different regions and continents. The application is also expected to record GPS data from fields or field boundaries. With a view to the European Regulation on Deforestation-free Products, this can enable products to be traced right back to their origin. Data on the supply chain, such as what prices are paid, which processing steps take place and which actors are involved, is stored digitally and, if desired, can also be viewed by consumers via a QR code.    

In addition, the [INATrace App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sunesis.inatrace) allows for the mapping of field polygons and farmer profiles. With the integration of FAO’s [WHISP Tool](https://whisp.earthmap.org/login), a first deforestation check can be conducted. . Thus, the data collected through INATrace plays a valuable role in meeting due diligence requirements of the new [EU Deforestation Regulation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/resource.html?uri=cellar:b42e6f40-4878-11ec-91ac-01aa75ed71a1.0001.02/DOC_1&format=PDF) (EUDR), making it a key tool in the compliance process.   

With the introduction of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (LkSG), the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), and the upcoming Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), companies in the processing, wholesale, and retail sectors are increasingly responsible for ensuring compliance with human rights and environmental protection within their supply chains. These regulations emphasize the importance of transparency, particularly at the earlier stages of global supply chains. In a market where traceability solutions remain fragmented, INATrace addresses the needs of stakeholders at the beginning of supply chains. By using INATrace, cooperatives can transition from paper or Excel-based systems to fully transparent and digital processes, while maintaining ownership of their data, thereby improving their negotiating power with buyers.


## **Data ownership, privacy, and fair value distribution**

Digital solutions for traceability raise important questions around **data ownership, privacy, and fair value distribution**. Properly managed, smallholder farmer data represents real value. In a digitized world, farmers do not only produce crops but also generate information that can help improve yields, optimize crop selection, and connect to markets, finance, inputs, and services.

A **fair and inclusive farm data ecosystem** ensures that the benefits of this data are shared equitably among all stakeholders. Policies and regulations are needed to govern the **capture, storage, and responsible use** of farm data. When implemented properly, such an ecosystem can return fair value to the original data owners: the smallholder farmers themselves.

Building this system involves both **functional** and **ethical** challenges:  

- **Functional challenges**:  
  - How to make farmers’ data **available, accessible, affordable, joinable, and interoperable**? 
  - How to ensure **quality data at scale**?  
  - How to establish **local ownership** and stewardship of data?  

- **Ethical challenges**:  
  - How do farmers’ data rights relate to privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR) and proprietary technologies?  
  - How to create a **fair value chain** when data passes through multiple layers of aggregation or processing?  
  - How to balance **proprietary algorithms** (e.g., remote sensing tools) with the farmers’ need for **open and shared value**?  

Addressing these questions requires **collaboration among policymakers, farmers, companies, and technology providers.** Leveraging **existing sustainability programs and digital tools in the field** can reduce implementation costs and utilize data that is already being collected. However, growing adoption of digital tools often happens in a **non-standardized way**, producing data that is difficult to reuse outside its original context. Successful cases of **interoperability** between independent digital solutions demonstrate that connecting complementary platforms—despite differences in technology and database architecture—can **scale impact and reduce costs**. 

Regardless of the specific approach or project, **interoperation between digital tools with complementary value propositions** (e.g., field data collection solutions and carbon emissions calculators) is becoming increasingly essential for scaling sustainability projects efficiently and maximizing their impact.
