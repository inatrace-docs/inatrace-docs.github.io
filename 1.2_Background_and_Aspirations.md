# 1.2 Background and Aspirations

## INATrace – the tracing tool for sustainable supply chains 

INATrace is a **digital open-source solution** that puts people first. With the aim of improving the economic situation of smallholder farmers, INATrace focuses on the [traceability of global supply chains](https://www.sustainable-supply-chains.org/topics/digitalisation-traceability/). Better payment for producers at the beginning of the supply chain can only be secured if it becomes clear how little they receive for the raw material produced compared to other actors.   

On behalf of BMZ, GIZ has been working with users to develop an open source, expandable and transferable digital solution for tracing produce in agricultural supply chains. The application aims to render the supply chain transparent from production to the consumers. INATrace is already being used in several agricultural supply chains across different regions and continents. The application is also expected to record GPS data from fields or field boundaries. With a view to the European Regulation on Deforestation-free Products, this can enable products to be traced right back to their origin. Data on the supply chain, such as what prices are paid, which processing steps take place and which actors are involved, is stored digitally and, if desired, can also be viewed by consumers via a QR code.    

In addition, the [INATrace App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sunesis.inatrace) allows for the mapping of field polygons and farmer profiles. With the integration of FAO’s [WHISP Tool](https://whisp.earthmap.org/login), a first deforestation check can be conducted. . Thus, the data collected through INATrace plays a valuable role in meeting due diligence requirements of the new [EU Deforestation Regulation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/resource.html?uri=cellar:b42e6f40-4878-11ec-91ac-01aa75ed71a1.0001.02/DOC_1&format=PDF) (EUDR), making it a key tool in the compliance process.   

With the introduction of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (LkSG), the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), and the upcoming Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), companies in the processing, wholesale, and retail sectors are increasingly responsible for ensuring compliance with human rights and environmental protection within their supply chains. These regulations emphasize the importance of transparency, particularly at the earlier stages of global supply chains. In a market where traceability solutions remain fragmented, INATrace addresses the needs of stakeholders at the beginning of supply chains. By using INATrace, cooperatives can transition from paper or Excel-based systems to fully transparent and digital processes, while maintaining ownership of their data, thereby improving their negotiating power with buyers.


## Data Ownership, Privacy, and Fair Value Distribution  
### Context and Aspirations

With digitalisation and traceability becoming central to sustainable supply chains, farm‐level data is no longer just an operational byproduct, it is an asset since this data can strengthen decision‑making, connect farmers to better services, and improve their share of value in the supply chain.

However, this opportunity comes with responsibility. Without appropriate governance, there is a risk that producers provide data but reap few benefits. To foster equity, transparency, and trust, data ownership, privacy, and fair value distribution must form integral pillars of modern agricultural digital systems.

## Key Challenges


| Dimension | Current Challenges | Aspirations |
|-----------|--------------------|-------------|
| **Functional** | - Data often resides in isolated silos, is not interoperable, or accessible only with high transaction costs. <br> - Data quality varies and often depends on external platforms which may not support local control. <br> - Producers have little or no control over how their data is stored, shared, or used. | - Data that can **easily be accessed and shared along the supply chain**, and can be joined or linked across platforms. <br> - High‐quality, reliable data at scale, collected in ways respectful of local contexts. <br> - **Local ownership and stewardship** - producers and farmer cooperatives have control. |
| **Ethical / Regulatory** | - Unclear or weak protections for privacy; questions over consent and data rights. <br> - Value is lost as data passes through multiple layers—aggregation, processing, resale—without benefit returning to the original data generators. | - Clear rules and practices that ensure **consent, privacy, and control over data**. <br> - Transparent value chains where producers are recognised and compensated for the use of their data (monetarily or through services/benefits). 


## Vision for an Inclusive Data Ecosystem

To realise a more equitable system, the following elements are essential:

**Platform Interoperability & Standards**  
   - Systems should not be built in isolation. Interoperability enables different tools (traceability, carbon accounting, input systems) to work together.  
   - Standards (data formats, metadata, consent, privacy) help ensure that data generated in one setting can be used elsewhere, reducing duplication, lowering cost, and increasing impact.

**Inclusive Business Models**  
   - Models that ensure farmers are rewarded for their data: perhaps via premium prices, access to better services (finance, inputs), or capacity building.  
   - Transparency in contracts and partnerships: farmers should understand how data is being used and what value they receive in return.

**Capacity and Trust Building**  
   - Local institutions (cooperatives, farmer groups) should be empowered to steward data.  
   - Trust is essential: mechanisms for accountability, fairness, and protection from misuse will encourage adoption.



## Why This Matters

- **Regulatory pressures are increasing.** Laws like the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), and national due diligence legislation demand transparency and traceability. Ensuring proper data practices gives supply chain actors (especially at the farm level) greater negotiating power and legal security.

- **Digital tools are proliferating, but fragmentation undermines value.** Many projects collect data, yet the lack of standardisation and openness means much of this data remains locked in formats or systems that cannot communicate with each other, limiting scale.

- **Potential for shared value.** When designed responsibly, farm data can unlock benefits across the chain: improved inputs, better finance, climate services, stronger bargaining positions—not just for companies, but for producers.



## Towards Shared Success

Our aspiration is to see agricultural value chains in which:

- All stakeholders, including farmers, **own and control their data**, deciding who uses it, how and under what terms.  
- The benefits derived from farm data—whether financial, technical, or social—**flow back to the farmers themselves**.  
- Digital tools and platforms are **open, transparent, interoperable**, enabling scaling of traceability, sustainability, and social impact
- Regulatory and policy environments support these principles and provide safeguards for privacy, consent, and fair value distribution.
