### **LOGIN**

**I forgot my password. Can you reset it?**

You can do it yourself by clicking on the “Forgot password” button in the login menu.

### **MY STOCK - DATA RECORDING**

**I recorded a process but the batch disappeared / does not appear for the next processing step on the input side. Where did it go?**

You might have selected the wrong output facility. Go to “All stock” and check your different facilities to find out where your batch is located at the moment. Start recording the next process or transfer from there.

**I made a mistake during data recording. How can I correct it?**

Go to the “All Stock” section and select “Edit” in the Action menu. Note that you can only edit your last processing action. If you recorded another processing action afterwards already on the same batch you will have to delete this last processing action first in the same section of the system. Note that you need to be a company admin for this. In case you don’t have company admin rights, ask the person in your company who does have them for assistance.

**We introduced a new semi-product / evidence filed / evidence document in our company which is not available in the system yet. How can we add it?**

Write an email to [support@inatrace.org](mailto:support@inatrace.org) so that a system administrator can add it for you in the systems settings and add it to your value chain. Afterwards, you will have it available in your company configuration drop-down menus.

### **FARMER PROFILES**

**  
I am trying to upload an Excel sheet with farmer profiles but it does not work. What am I doing wrong?**

First, note that you need to be a regional admin in order to upload Excel files to the farmer section. Otherwise, you can either add the farmers one by one or ask your regional INATrace contact person for assistance.

If you are a regional admin and have the necessary rights to upload an Excel sheet in this section, here are some common causes which make the system rejecting the file:

1.     The template used was not up-to-date. Always download the newest version under “All stock” > “Farmers” > “Import farmers”.

2.     The template was modified. Adding or deleting columns or rows or modifying the format otherwise will make the system rejecting the file when uploading.

3.     Your data entries are not in line with the allowed values of a specific column (e.g. if only “Y” and “N” are allowed, you cannot type in “Yes”.

4.     You have a formula in one or several cells. All data entries need to be converted to “value”.

5.     You added a space in one or several data cell at the beginning of the cell or you have entered a space (by clicking the spacebar) instead of leaving it empty in a column that is meant for numbers or dates.

6.     Dates entered are non-existing or format for date was altered

### **ORDERS**

**My supplier fulfilled my order, but the batch does not show up under my stock / in my storage. Why is this?**

You may still have to “approve” the batch(es) allocated to your order. Go to “Orders” > “Placed orders” and select “Approve / Reject” for your specific order in the Action menu. If the batch fulfills your requirements, click “Approve”. The batch is now allocated to your storage.

### **FINAL PRODUCTS**

**We introduced a new packaging size for our product. Where can I add it in the system?**

You add it under “Product” > “Final Product”. Note that your company must be the “Product admin” in order to do so (Check under “Stakeholders”). In case the packaging size is not available in the drop-down menu, write an email to [support@inatrace.org](mailto:support@inatrace.org) so that a system administrator can add it for you in the systems settings and add it to your value chain. Note that you will have to create new processing actions in your company configuration in order to record any processes for your new final product. Check the user guide for further details.

### **B2C AND QR CODE**

**Where in the system can I create a QR code?**

Under “My Stock” > “Processing” you should find a processing action called “Create QR Code”. If this is not the case, the configuration still has to set up for this. This includes product configuration (adding a QR label and Final product) and company configuration (setting up a processing action). Please find more details on this in the User Guide.

**Where do I find the QR Code I created for my batch?**

Go to your “All stock” section and switch to “Single view”. You find the QR button link in the “Actions” menu. By clicking on the QR Code image you copy the URL and can paste it e.g. into a new browser tab.

**I scanned the QR Code but there is no information showing. Why?**

First, make sure to use a QR Code which is a batch-specific QR Code (found under “All stock” > Single view” > “Actions” > “QR”). Second, check that the QR label which is linked to your QR Code is “Published” (Go to “Product” > “QR Label” to check this.).

**How do I add pictures or videos for the B2C site?**

You upload pictures in your company profile in the sections “Production records” and “Meet the farmers”. Videos need to be uploaded on YouTube. You then copy the link in the “Videos” section of your company profile. Next, go to “Product” > “QR labels” and select the QR label you are using for your final product. Scroll down and tick the pictures and videos” you would like to link to your B2C website.

**The B2C website does not show the individual processing steps in the product journey although they have been recorded. Why?**

For each processing step you would like to see in your product journey, you need to have the processing name translation filled in your configuration (“Company Profile” > “Processing action”) in the language of your QR label. Make sure to also fill the field “Public timeline label”.

**I have changed the layout of the B2C page / added content but it does not show up when scanning the QR code.**

Make sure to add / edit the information in the correct section. Go to “Product” > “QR Labels” and click on the QR Label which is linked to the Final Product that holds the QR Code.

**I cannot make any changes / edits in the Product section. Data input fields are grayed out. Why is this?**

Your company may not be the product admin of your value chain. Go to “Product” > “Stakeholders”, scroll down to check which company is the product admin and ask them to conduct the necessary changes.
