## INATrace as an Open Source Alternative 

[INATrace](https://www.sustainable-supply-chains.org/topics/digitalisation-traceability/inatrace/) is a digital traceability solution for agricultural raw materials — from production to the final product. With the increasing demand for sustainable agricultural products and the growing importance of corporate due diligence (e.g., through the EU Deforestation Regulation, EUDR), there is a pressing need for transparent and traceable supply chains.

However, available traceability solutions are often not **adaptable** and lack **interoperability** with other systems. Typically, these applications are not **open source**, creating a **dependency** on the respective IT provider. Small-scale farmers, in particular, face challenges in this context: they often have very **limited influence over the use of their data** or the **selection of traceability solution providers**.

**INATrace software’s source code is openly available**, allowing IT companies and supply chain actors to adapt it according to their needs. The **Principles for Digital Development** form the foundation of INATrace, particularly the principle of *“Design with the User.”*

In practice, INATrace enables farmer organizations to digitally record all production steps, manage their own data, and transfer relevant traceability data to subsequent supply chain actors. As an extension of the **INATrace web app**, an **offline INATrace App** makes it possible to **create farmer profiles** and **map farmers' fields**. This data is then automatically synced with the desktop version, where a first deforestation check can be conducted for each **polygon**. This is enabled through an interface with the **FAO's WHISP (“WHat IS in that Plot?”)** tool and the use of unique anonymous geo-IDs provided by the **Asset Registry** of the AgStack project by the Linux Foundation.

## Benefits of Using INATrace

One of the main advantages of INATrace is that as an open source project, there are **no license fees**, which means that resources can be directed toward customization, integration, and training rather than recurring software costs. You should though consider that there will still be costs for hosting and maintenance if you outsource these services. 

**Transparency** is another strength. Because the source code is openly available, it can be audited for security, compliance, and data handling. This fosters trust among supply chain partners and regulators, who increasingly require visibility into how data is collected and managed.

INATrace has also been designed with flexibility in mind. It can be **tailored to different crops, traceability mechanisms, or local conditions**, avoiding the “one-size-fits-all” limitations of many proprietary solutions. This flexibility also means **reduced dependency** on single vendors, allowing organizations to shape the tool around their needs.

As an open source initiative, INATrace benefits from community contributions. Improvements made by others can feed back into the project, and organizations adopting the system can play an active role in shaping its direction. This **collective approach** supports collaboration across cooperatives, certification bodies, and buyers.

Finally, INATrace is aligned with wider **vision of inclusive, sustainable, and verifiable agricultural supply chains.** Developed with support from GIZ, it emphasizes transparent supply chains and accountability, which can strengthen credibility with donors, certification schemes, and partners.

## Things to Consider Before Adopting INATrace

Despite the benefits, INATrace is not a turnkey solution. Implementing and running the system **requires technical expertise**. Hosting, customization, and integration with existing IT landscapes will typically need either internal developers or an external partner with relevant experience. 

Unlike commercial software, **INATrace does not come with guaranteed vendor support**. Maintenance and troubleshooting will rely on the capacity of your team and the openness of the community. This means that organizations should plan for long-term technical stewardship rather than expecting a ready-made service.

Documentation in open source projects is often a work in progress, and INATrace is no exception. Teams adopting the system may encounter a learning curve, especially if they are new to the technology stack. Early **investment in knowledge building** is important.

Another point to keep in mind is that INATrace’s **development roadmap is still under construction**. Compared to larger open source projects, INATrace’s ecosystem is still relatively small, which can mean fewer third-party extensions and less peer support. This is not a barrier, but it emphasizes the importance of internal capacity.

Finally, **successful implementation depends on people as much as technology**. Farmers, cooperatives, and buyers will need onboarding and training, and in some contexts there may be resistance to moving away from paper-based systems. Change management should be treated as an integral part of the adoption process.

## Making the Decision

INATrace is well suited for organizations that value transparency, flexibility, and alignment with sustainability initiatives, and that have access to technical capacity or trusted partners. For organizations seeking a fully supported, off-the-shelf product with minimal in-house IT involvement, a proprietary alternative may be a better fit. By weighing the benefits and the considerations outlined above, teams can decide whether INATrace matches their goals and capabilities.
