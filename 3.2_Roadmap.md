# 3.2 Roadmap

INATrace is actively developing a public roadmap to make our development priorities more transparent. The roadmap will help contributors, partners, and users understand:

- Which features are currently in focus
- What improvements are planned for upcoming releases
- Where external contributions can have the most impact

At this stage, the roadmap is **under development**. 

Some examples on core functions that INATrace would benefit from: 

- Blocking the mixing (merging) of conforming and nonconforming batches
- Comparison of the accumulative volume with annual farm/plot production potential specifying a percentage of tolerance (margin of error) on the annual production quotas
- Alerts on and communicate reports on quality, productivity, payments, non-conformities etc to farmers
- FarmerID as a digital wallet solution based on Self-Sovereign Identity, which allows farmers to connect to the agriculture supply chain, empowering them with their own digital identity and record of financial transactions
- Data ownership framework that supports democratizing data
- Due diligence functionalities
- Standards compliance functions / document sharing and checklists for certification (e.g. FT, EU organic, Rainforest)
- System translation into additional languages

In the meantime:
