## Processing Module

The processing module allows users to record all activities related to processing raw materials or semi-products as well as to document transfers from one facility to another.

### General Note on recording processing actions

Each supply chain is different, each company’s configuration and user interface in INATrace are different. This is especially true regarding the company’s facilities and processing actions.

KEEP IN MIND:
All processes need to be recorded in a chronological order AFTER adding all deliveries which are part of the processing action.
You will need to identify your product batch through all processing steps. The system will therefore ask you for an internal lot number which represents the unique identifier for your batch. 

When recording a processing action, make sure to select the correct output facility if your product changes the location as part of a specific processing action. Note: The input facility for your processing action 2 needs to be the same one as your output facility of processing action 1. Otherwise you will not be able to select your batch for processing action 2. 

**In the following, we show how to document processing actions from delivery to the company’s final storage for an exemplary coffee supply chain. If you want to see the same User Interface in the Processing Module, you will have to first configure the processing actions accordingly. If you don't see any facilities or processing actions under "Processing", this means the configuration of your company's facilites and processing actions is still pending.**

### Pre-Processing

To record a processing action, click on the “Company” icon as shown on the screenshot below which leads you to “My Stock”. You can also go direct to “My stock” tile as shown below.

The page has two main parts: 
“Material to be recorded” refers to the input material that is processed,
“Outputs of this recording” refers to the results after processing.
