## Processing Module

The processing module allows users to record all activities related to processing raw materials or semi-products as well as to document transfers from one facility to another.

### General Note on recording processing actions

Each supply chain is different, each company’s configuration and user interface in INATrace are different. This is especially true regarding the company’s facilities and processing actions.

KEEP IN MIND:
All processes need to be recorded in a chronological order AFTER adding all deliveries which are part of the processing action.
You will need to identify your product batch through all processing steps. The system will therefore ask you for an internal lot number which represents the unique identifier for your batch. 

When recording a processing action, make sure to select the correct output facility if your product changes the location as part of a specific processing action. Note: The input facility for your processing action 2 needs to be the same one as your output facility of processing action 1. Otherwise you will not be able to select your batch for processing action 2. 

**In the following, we show how to document processing actions from delivery to the company’s final storage for an exemplary coffee supply chain. If you want to see the same User Interface in the Processing Module, you will have to first configure the processing actions accordingly. If you don't see any facilities or processing actions under "Processing", this means the configuration of your company's facilites and processing actions is still pending.**

### Pre-Processing

To record a processing action, click on the “Company” icon as shown on the screenshot below which leads you to “My Stock”. You can also go direct to “My stock” tile as shown below.

### Create a new farmer profile and add plots

Inside the “Farmers” page, click on “Add Farmer” button to create a new farmer profile. 

![producers54](/images/producers54.png)

#### Add plots

After adding Basic information and Address to a farmer's profile, you can add plots by clicking on “draw plot”. Alternatively, you can also add plots using the mobile app. 

![producers55](/images/producers55.png)

You can choose to add boundaries if you are familiar with the boundaries of the plot or you can add a single point if you don’t have the detailed plot information. 

![producers56](/images/producers56.png)

If you selected “Boundaries”, you can now define the corners of the plot by clicking on the map. You can always use “Undo last point” or “Delete plot” in case you clicked in a wrong place. You also have the option to switch between Satellite view and Default view for better orientation. Next: Fill in the plot information and click “Confirm”.

![producers57](/images/producers57.png)

If you selected “Single point”, you can now define where the plot is located by clicking on the map. You can always use “Delete plot” in case you clicked in a wrong place and place the mark again. You also have the option to switch between Satellite view and Default view for better orientation. Next: Fill in the plot information and click “Confirm”.

![producers58](/images/producers58.png)

After adding your plot, you will be directed back to the the farmer profile. You can add additional plots by drawing them or uploading geo-data.  

To  complete the farmer information, you can add additional farmer information like contact details or bank information. This is optional. In the ”Companies” section the farmer is already allocated to your company / organization. You do not have to select anything here. You will only be able to link a farmer to an association in case the association uses INATrace as well and has an active company profile. 

![producers60](/images/producers60.png)

Complete now the information about the farm by adding the total size of the farm and the cultivated area with the specific crop you are tracking. The product type will already be pre-selected in the farmer profile. You can add an additional crop under “product type” though in case the product type was configured by the admin. Click “Save” to finish the process of adding a new farmer. 

![producers61](/images/producers61.png)

### Export and analyze geo data

Once you have added a plot, you will have the additional button “Export geo-data” available inside the farmer profile. This allows you to export a .json file with the farmer’s geo data in order to analyse the deforestation risk in a next step. By clicking on the pen icon next to your plot, you can also see and copy the Geo-ID of a specific plot in case you want to analyse a single plot.

![producers59](/images/producers59.png)

Once you have downloaded or copied your geo data, you can use a free tool like https://whisp.earthmap.org to analyze your data for deforestation risk. You will have to select your area of interest,and then use the „+“ symbol to add the plot boundaries. Next, you have to upload the file you exported from INATrace (Option 1). Note that if you have a .json file, you will have to rename the file name ending into .geojson before uploading. You can also paste in directly the Geo-ID that you copied from a specific farmer plot in INATrace (Option 2). 

![whisp1](/images/whisp1.png)

After adding the plot(s), you have a number of different analytical tools available on the right side of the user interface. You can also activate or deactivate specific layers on the left side of the user interface. [Here](https://www.nachhaltige-agrarlieferketten.org/fileadmin/user_upload/whisp_20240503_INA_lunchbreak.pdf) you find more extensive information and resources about the Whisp tool.
