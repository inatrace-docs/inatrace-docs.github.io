# 2.4 Admin Guide

The Admin Guide helps you with the first steps on how to set up INATrace **after you successfully installed
the system**. If you still need to install the system, please refer to the existing [GitHub documentation](https://github.com/INATrace) and to the [Technical Implementaiton Guide](2.2_Technical_Implementation_Guide.md).

In order to set up INATrace, you need to **configure the different parts of INATrace** chronologically (system level, value chain level, company level, product level). In case one of these parts is not
configured correctly, company users will not be able to use the system.

After completing these steps, you can **onboard new users** and link them to their respective companies. You can also assist the companies in uploading Farmer lists.

This guide is **NOT a User Guide** and also does **NOT include information on how to set up individual
company configurations**. This information can be found in the User Guides.
