## Pilot Projects

Valuable experiences from **pilot projects** in Rwanda, Honduras and Costa Rica show that INATrace can already be used flexibly along different agricultural supply chains. In Rwanda or Costa Rica, pilot projects used INATrace for Coffee, Macadamia and Pineapple value chains. The open-source code enables INATrace to be uniquely customized, allowing for the addition of new features tailored to specific needs.

## Example Rwanda 

In the case of the coffee supply chain from Rwanda, women’s cooperatives are involved, which market the already roasted and packaged coffee through a trader in Germany. With the aid of software-specific training and hardware for the cooperatives, the data are stored in a blockchain-based database. Consumers can scan a QR code to call up information on the origin, quality, production processes, certificates and prices paid. This solution creates transparency along the entire supply chain, helps in meeting corporate due diligence requirements, and opens up new markets for the producers. In the best case, this also leads to higher incomes for the coffee producers, who also have access to their data. Open interfaces make it possible to link additional important services to INATrace, such as digital marketplaces, financial services and advice. One example here is the interface to the digital coffee market platform Beyco, through which the coffee recorded in INATrace can be offered directly for sale, and contracts can be concluded with buyers.
