# 1.1 What is INATrace?

## **What is INATrace?**

- **An open-source traceability and farm management system** designed to track and manage agricultural products along the supply chain, from farmer to final buyer.

- **A complex, multi-tenant and open-source web application** developed using a micro-service-based architecture. 

- **A GIZ-initiated digital open-source product**, developed in cooperation with partners, with source code available on GitHub.

- **A Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI)** component designed to strengthen transparency and fairness in agricultural supply chains

 - **Customizable and self-hostable** — you can deploy your own instance on local servers or cloud infrastructure.

 - **Designed with a farmer focus**, supporting farmers in digitizing their processes and have data access (e.g., for internal management, certification support and compliance reporting).

- INATrace **reduces dependency** on proprietary platforms and fostering inclusive, sustainable, and verifiable agricultural supply chains.

- **Community-driven** — improvements are shared openly, with a global developer and user community contributing to its evolution.

- **Modular and extensible**, allowing adaptation to different crops, supply chains, and country contexts.

## **What is INATrace not?**

- **Not a commercial SaaS product** — INATrace is not a paid subscription service; you must host and maintain your own instance or contract a local provider.

- **Not a one-size-fits-all solution** — it could require customization to match local workflows, regulations, and language (however already very customizable)

- **Not a plug-and-play solution** — technical setup and configuration are required before it can be used.

- **Not a private or proprietary solution** — all code is open and must remain open under GitHub when modified and shared.
