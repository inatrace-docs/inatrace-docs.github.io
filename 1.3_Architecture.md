This page provides a high-level overview of INATrace’s architecture, including its main components, data flow, and how different modules interact.

# Architecture Overview

INATrace is an open-source traceability system designed for agricultural supply chains. The system aims to enhance transparency, trust, and efficiency by digitally recording and verifying each step in the supply chain.

## Core Components

INATrace is composed of four main modules:

1. **Backend (Java)**: 
   - Implements the core business logic and data processing.
   - Manages interactions with the blockchain to ensure data integrity and immutability.
   - Provides RESTful APIs for frontend and mobile applications.

2. **Frontend (Angular)**: 
   - A web-based interface that allows users to interact with the system.
   - Provides functionalities for supply chain management, product tracking, and reporting.

3. **Mobile Application (TypeScript)**: 
   - A mobile app designed for field agents and farmers.
   - Supports offline data entry, GPS-based mapping, and synchronization with the backend when online.

4. **Coffee Network (Blockchain)**: 
   - A decentralized ledger that records all transactions and data entries.
   - Ensures data authenticity and traceability across the supply chain.

### Interface between INATrace and Beyco

As part of a further development of INATrace, **an interface has been created between the two applications INATrace and Beyco**, which offers new possibilities for transparency in production, purchase and sale. Coffee producers using INATrace are able to offer their coffee directly to potential buyers on the Beyco platform. In addition, sellers and buyers can negotiate contract conditions and conclude contracts on the platform. This offers mutual benefits, as Beyco has an extended offer, while producers using INATrace benefit from new opportunities to sell their coffee.

## Data Flow

The typical data flow in INATrace is as follows:

1. **Data Entry**: Users input data through the frontend or mobile application.
2. **Data Processing**: The backend processes the data, performs necessary validations, and prepares it for blockchain recording.
3. **Blockchain Recording**: Validated data is recorded on the blockchain, ensuring immutability and transparency.
4. **Data Retrieval**: Users can retrieve and view data through the frontend or mobile application, with access controls in place.

## Design Principles

- **Modularity**: Each component is designed to operate independently, allowing for easier maintenance and scalability.
- **Security**: Emphasis on data security and privacy, with blockchain providing an immutable record of transactions.
- **User-Centric**: Interfaces are designed to be intuitive and accessible, catering to users with varying levels of technical expertise.
